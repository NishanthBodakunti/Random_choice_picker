# Random_choice_picker
The Random Choice Picker project is a web-based application designed to help users make random selections from a list of options. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a simple and intuitive interface where users can input a list of choices—such as items for a raffle or names for a contest—and then randomly selects one option. The application ensures fairness and transparency in decision-making by leveraging JavaScript's random number generation capabilities. It enhances user experience with responsive design principles, making it accessible across different devices, and provides immediate feedback with the chosen result displayed prominently.
